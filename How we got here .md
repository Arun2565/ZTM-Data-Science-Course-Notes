Ex : A business collects customer data for analyzing and makes reports for it.

We used to have excel files then people got really good at it and went on to CSV files.

Relational DB : We needed a way to organize data , then we used MYSQL to read and write information from the database.

In 2000’s we had this concept named Big Data.

Big Data - Companies like Facebook, Amazon , Google had enormous amounts of data that it wasn’t possible to structure data and where they got messy, unstructured data.

ML - At a point we could not look at columns and tables and make business decisions. SO we gave it to machines which understand more about the data than humans could, also this shift happened due to the advancements of CPU and GPU.
