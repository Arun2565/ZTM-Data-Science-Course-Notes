# Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning is simply about predicting results based on incoming data.

Supervised learning : In this type we have a  labelled rows and columns and we know the output.

Ex : Classification and Regression.

Unsupervised Learning : It has unlabeled data. We or the machines need to label the data. Ex: Clustering and Associative Rule Learning.

Reinforcement Learning : Teaching machines through trial and error. 

Machine learning is a program or an algorithm to learn about different patterns in data and taking the learnings from the algorithm to make predictions about the future using  similar data.

Traditional vs ML

Traditional Programming : It is given a set of inputs and tasks to be performed on the input to get a certain outcome or an output.

ML : We start with an input and an ideal output. and it will come up with instructions to get the output.
