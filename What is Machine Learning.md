# What is Machine Learning?

Programming : Machines can do certain tasks really fast. Making machines do tasks for us  using programming languages is called programming.

Ex : To find location of a place, we can manually do it by pulling out a map and we can measure it using ruler. Or we can make the computer find the shortest path by programming it and then we can find it very fast.

Machine learning use case :  To detect the image is a cat or not.

We use ML for things we cannot describe to humans.

ML Applications : Self driving cars, Robots , NLP , recommendation engine, etc. Things that machines could not do before and only humans could do is now done by machines using ML.

The goal of ML is to make computers more and more intelligent to make us humans achieve our goals.
